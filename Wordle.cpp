/* This is a project to recreate wordle in c++. Wordle is a word game where the player must guess 
a 5-letter word in 6 guesses by using feedback given about whether a letter is in the correct
spot, exists in the word but is in a different spot, or that the letter doesn't exist in the word. 
The original game is available here: https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html
Unlike in the original, this version will allow guesses that aren't real words. */
